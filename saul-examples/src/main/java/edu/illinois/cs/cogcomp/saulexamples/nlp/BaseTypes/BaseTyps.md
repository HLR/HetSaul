# Saul NLP Base Types
Built in hierarchy of common linguistic units for processing text and NLP tasks
and a relation class that connects various linguistic units.
Nlp base types help to design data models in Saul and provide many built in feature 
extractors and helpers which the NLP sensors operate on them.

## Hierarchy
All classes of the hierarchy assumed to have a mandatory unique **id** throughout the entire corpora,
an optional **text**, and also an optional character based span which shows the **start** index and exclusive 
**end** index of each linguistic unit.

On the top level of the hierarchy we have the [`Document`](Document.java) class.
Each document contains many [`Sentences`](Sententce.java) which in turn can 
have many [`Phrases`](Phrases) and finally each phrase can contain many [`Tokens`](Token.java). 
Note that, you can omit one or more of these linguistic units for specific usages.

### Properties
We can specify additional properties for all hierarchy classes using
`setPropertyValue`. This function adds a value to the list of values for that property. 
The value list can be retrieved by `getPropertyValues` function. 
And there is the `getPropertyFirstValue` which returns the first 
value of the list for that property.

## Relation
Data modeling in Saul usually requires having edges between the model's nodes. 
[Relations](Relation.java) help to have a container that holds the information 
needed to construct those edges.

Each relation should have a unique **Id** and two or more **argumentId** which determine
the Id of the linguistic units that used in this relation. Additional properties can be added
using `setProperty` function.
